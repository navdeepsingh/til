# Options Meaning

- --save means those packages are required locally for the project and listed under the dependencies property.
- --save-dev adds the packages locally but as development dependencies. They are listed under devDependencies in package.json.
- -g indicates the package should be installed globally; this lets you execute grunt in your terminal, regardless of the current working directory.
