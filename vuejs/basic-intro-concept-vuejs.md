# Basic intro and concept of Vuejs

Vuejs is another simple Javascript framework which mainly focus on views. Trying to enlist some basic and main concept of this library as follows :

1. Reactive Data Binding : Makes it extremely simple to keep your data and the DOM in sync. In plain words, it means we use special syntax in our normal HTML templates to “bind” the DOM to the underlying data. Once the bindings are created, the DOM will then be kept in sync with the data. 

2. Composable view components : Components stand for a self-contained unit that has its own view and data logic.

3. Jquery is to manually manuplate the DOM with code, and the code is very imperative, repetitive and error prone. In Vuejs embraces the concept of **data-driven view**.

4. Term used mostly is **_reactive_** : The data and the DOM are now linked, and everything is now _reactive_

5. API of Vuejs is collection of  very selective methods like Options, Methods, Filters and many more. [Vuejs API](https://vuejs.org/api/)

6. Traditional getter/setter is being used also to get and set the value from and to the Vue instance.
